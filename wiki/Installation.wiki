#summary How to add this in to Blender
= Introduction =

The script is written to replace the existing FBX exporter.

= Location =

The current FBX exporter ships with Blender 2.5x beta.
Depending on the settings used while installing Blender the scripts may be in different locations.  On Windows if you accepted the default the scripts should be in the users application data folder.

"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.5x\scripts\op\io_scene_fbx"

or on a network

"%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.5x\scripts\op\io_scene_fbx"

The AppData folder is usually hidden.

= Installation =

Make sure you have exited Blender.
You must delete the compiled Python files from the above folder otherwise Blnder will use the old scripts.  The compiled files are the ones ending .pyc.
You can just delete all the files in that folder as you are about to replace them anyway.  

Copy both the modified script files in to that folder.

__init__.py

export_fbx.py

Start Blender and Export FBX from the File->Export menu as normal.
