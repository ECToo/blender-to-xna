== List of Changes ==

  * Added warning about lone edges
  * Added option to only output animations
  * Added the essential BIND_POSE line to the output
  * Option to exclude the Default_Take.tak name
  * Use the action name for the .tak filename
  * Added more descriptive instructions to the existing options
  * Added validation for XNA options to the UI
  * Added option to use the same folder for textures as the fbx is in
  * Output the selected action with its own name instead of Default_Take
  * Removed all rotations
  * Made the Armature a Limb
  * Changed the order of the connections so that the bones are before the defomations


== Notes ==

  * The armature must be a Limb.
  * Limb and LimbNode do the same thing as far as I can tell.
  * The armature must be parented to the scene.
  * The first bone must be parented to the armature.
  * Linear or curve L or c,n make no difference to the output.
  * The calculation of the Rotation (TX_CHAN == 'R') of the takes makes no difference.
  * I don't think the armature needs to be included as a bone in the animations because it always has a rotation of zero but I can't work out how to exclude it in the script!
