== List of Changes ==

  * Added warning about lone edges
  * Added option to only output animations
  * Added the essential BIND_POSE line to the output
  * Option to exclude the Default_Take.tak name
  * Use the action name for the .tak filename
  * Added more descriptive instructions to the existing options
  * Added validation for XNA options to the UI
  * Added option to use the same folder for textures as the fbx is in


== Notes ==

  * Decided to leave the armature as an empty for now.  Previously I had changed this to a LimbNode but I think that adds it unecessarily as a bone!
  * Might try not including the armature object at all as it does not appear to be needed by XNA and just adds an extra bone or a warning message depending on how it is included!
