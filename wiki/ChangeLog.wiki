Submitted patch #28118 29 July 2011

== Notes ==

  * The armature must be a Limb.
  * Limb and LimbNode do the same thing as far as I can tell.
  * The armature must be parented to the scene.
  * The first bone must be parented to the armature.
  * Linear or curve L or c,n make no difference to the output.
  * The calculation of the Rotation (TX_CHAN == 'R') of the takes makes no difference.
  * I don't think the armature needs to be included as a bone in the animations because it always has a rotation of zero but I can't work out how to exclude it in the script!
  * The order of the connections does not matter although I would always want the bones in order just in case.
