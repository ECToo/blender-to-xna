= Summary =

The Autodesk FBX Importer shipped with XNA 4.0 can only load one animation in each FBX file.  These scripts are written taking that in to account.

- Export the Model Only as an FBX.

- Export each Blender action as an FBX animation in to separate files.

- Load the model in to XNA and merge the animations.  See Shawn Hargreaves blog on how to merge animations or use my TakeExtrator model viewer for testing.


= Details =

If you have followed the installation instructions you should have 3 new menu items on the Export menu in Blender.  _XNA FBX Model Only, XNA FBX Animations_ and _XNA FBX Animated Model._

The _XNA FBX Model Only_ exports the model with armature (if present) but only in the rest pose.  No animations.  This produces the smallest file size compatible with being animated in XNA.

The _XNA FBX Animations_ option (still W.I.P) is intended to use to export each animation one at a time.  In pose mode in Blender select whichever action you want to export.  Then select the _Export -> XNA FBX Animations_ from the menu and save that selected action.  Repeat selecting an action and exporting it for each animation you want to use in XNA.

TakeExtractor project which lets you load a model and then load individual animations from FBX files.
