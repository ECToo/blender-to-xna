In the process of trying to rotate the animations I stumbled across a difference in the FBX file format that I had not noticed.  It was the same in the Blender 2.4x version of the FBX exporter but different in the sample FBX file I was comparing them to.

I changed the armature from being a 'Null' to being a 'LimbNode' object.  That simple change fixed everything.

The FBX SDK importer used for XNA still requires the animations to be in separate FBX files but that suits me anyway.  Shawn Hargreaves shows a method of merging them in the XNA pipeline if that is your preference.

I need to tidy up the scripts to remove unnecessary code and confusing UI options.
Revision 75 works but the code and UI are untidy anything newer than that will be neater.
