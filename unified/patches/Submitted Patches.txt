#28118 29-07-2011

Message 30-07-2011:
Attached a slightly updated patch, it changes...
* invert enable_rotation to use_rotate_workaround, options like this should be 'False'.

* some indentation was changed for FBX output when it only needed to be changed for the write funcs.

* move add_action_to_filepath and validate_xna_options to private class methods and addressed one of the issues in you;re comments about set usage.


Review (issues numbered from the result of having my modified patch applied).

* Would have preferred if the "takes_only" option not be apart of this patch since it seems its not essential for XNA compatibility and makes the patch harder to review, Could you split this patch? - XNA compat at first, after add features which are convenient.

* 222: Making mtx4_z90 and identity matrix seems to be needed, but does this work for XNA and break other cases?, if its not needed perhaps it can be made an identity() every time?

* 466: Setting the matrix to be ob.matrix_local does not ensure its not rotated or scaled, Im not sure what you are trying to do here.
  infact because the matrix is from "matrix = ob.matrix_local * mtx4_z90", and mtx4_z90 is an identity matrix I dont think this is needed at all.

* 2257: When armature_limb is enabled, normal empty objects are not exported, is this intentional?. looks like this could be moved out of the 'if'

* 2545 -> 2618: This block of code has been duplicated and edited but seems to contain very similar code, rather not do this if possible.

Reply 30-07-2011:
Thanks for showing me the correct usage in the code.

* The takes_only option was the first thing I added before making any other changes.  XNA only supports one animation per file so being able to output individual takes quickly and test the import quickly is important for my use of the script.  
All it does is exclude large sections of the FBX output.  It should be fairly easy to follow.  In most cases it is the same code indented one level.  I have also tested with and without it a lot during testing of the script.

* 222: I do not know what mtx4_z90 does.  I thought it was you that had written it!  As far as I am concerned it breaks armature rotation which is why I set it to indentity() and disable rotation altogether.
I have tried several times to work out the maths for the armature rotation but failed.

* 466: See line 455 which in some cases changes it to matrix = par_matrix.inverted() * matrix
That does not work for XNA so I had to have the special case.  I tested this several times and always XNA needs matrix = ob.matrix_local

* 2253 (was 2257):  Yes it was deliberate not to export any nulls.  XNA has no concept of an empty or null object.  
I have changed it to allow for other applications.  Nulls are included if 'EMPTY' is selected

* 2549... (was 2545...): I agree.  I have removed the prior code in this latest patch.

* 2570-2509:  Please check that my thinking is correct.  Armatures are already listed by ob_all_typegroups at line 2448.  Adding them at line 2570 as well duplicates the same connection!

I've e-mailed the file to Campbell (ideasman_42) because I do not have permission to upload the patch here!!!!!!!

The 'takes_only' option has been removed from the patch.
Bug fix included: I have now excluded some sections where they are not applicable if 'MESH' or 'CAMERA' have not been selected as output types.

I have added additional validation to the UI so that it is not possible to output animations without the armature.  Campbell, thanks for the syntax help on that today.

Minor changes to the UI to move the order of options slightly.  
Trying to keep the most frequently used options near the top.  
That means the XNA compatible options are near the botton with Batch options last.
Renamed the 'Rotate Fix' to make it clearer that it is only needed to fix animations.

* 2485 -> 2551:
I have decided to REMOVE 'Default_Take' from the exporter instead of making it an option.
I can find no reason for it being there!  Anyone who needs the name 'Default_Take' can add an action with that name.
Most FBX files I have looked at use the name 'Take_001' instead and the only reference to 'Default_Take' is always about Blender.
As mentioned above, in my opinion, removing 'Default_Take' is essential to the XNA pipeline.  

I searched using Google and I even searched the FBX SDK.
The nearest reference to it was in a May 2010 Readme for the 2011.3 version of the FBX SDK.
http://infiniteengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/depends/fbx/readme.txt
In that the behaviour was changed so the 'default take and current take are no longer set.'
Other people struggling with the name 'Default_Take':

* was 2490, 2506 -> 2516: I have removed these because they were pointless.  
The action_lastcompat was only set at the same time the count was incremented.  
Therefore the following if condition was only ever met if action_lastcompat was also still empty!
